- MVP:
    - Bootloader:
        - Automatically detects CAN baud rate
        - Supports UAVCAN dynamic node ID allocation
        - Can flash application via UAVCAN firmware update mechanism
        - Validates application via CRC64, reports critical state if application is invalid
        - Reports application software version data per UAVCAN specification
        - Switches LEDs off immediately
        - Boots immediately if the I2C slave interface is connected to a master
        - Follows guidance provided by loaded application vis-a-vis:
            - Boot timeout (default = forever)
            - UAVCAN initial baud rate (default = 1e6)
            - UAVCAN auto baud enable (default = enabled)
            - UAVCAN initial node ID (default = dynamically allocated)
        - Provides data to application:
            - Hardware/UAVCAN node name
            - Hardware version
            - UAVCAN baud rate, if detected
            - UAVCAN local node id, if detected or specified by application
            - Boot reason (firmware update, timeout, reboot command, or I2C slave interface present)
    - Application:
        - Provides UAVCAN interface for debugging and firmware update
        - Provides driver for onboard ICM-20948 (compass only)
        - Provides driver for onboard LEDs
        - Tristates GPS UART pins
        - Provides functional AC3.5-compliant (toshibaLED) LED protocol on I2C slave interface
        - Provides functional AC3.5-compliant (HMC5983 or AK09916) compass protocol on I2C slave interface
